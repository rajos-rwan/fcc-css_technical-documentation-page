          JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is
          primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on the web.
          It runs directly in the browser, allowing developers to respond to
          user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard input.
          JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to control structure, style,
          and behavior on a webpage. Over time, it has grown beyond the browser
          and is now also used on servers, mobile applications, and desktop
          software. Because of its flexibility and wide support, JavaScript has
          become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

        <p>
          Variables are used in JavaScript to store data values that can be
          accessed and modified throughout a program. These values may represent
          numbers, text, boolean values, objects, or even functions. By using
          variables, developers can write flexible and reusable code that adapts
          to different situations. Variables help make programs easier to
          understand by giving meaningful names to data instead of using raw
          values everywhere. Proper use of variables is essential for writing
          clear, maintainable, and scalable JavaScript applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript provides three main keywords for declaring variables:
          <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>. The
          <code>var</code> keyword is older and has function scope, which can
          sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. The <code>let</code> keyword
          introduces block scoping and allows reassignment of values. The
          <code>const</code> keyword is used for values that should not be
          reassigned, helping prevent accidental changes and improving code
          reliability.
        </p>
        <code>
          let age = 25;
          const name = "Alex";
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific
          task within a program. They allow developers to group related
          instructions together and execute them whenever needed. By using
          functions, large programs can be broken down into smaller, more
          manageable pieces. This improves readability and makes debugging much
          easier. Functions also help reduce repetition by allowing the same
          logic to be reused in multiple places throughout an application.
        </p>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, functions can accept parameters, which act as variables
          that receive values when the function is called. Parameters make
          functions more flexible by allowing them to operate on different data
          each time they run. This means a single function can handle many
          different scenarios without being rewritten. Well-designed functions
          are general enough to be reused in multiple contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions can also return values back to the part of the program that
          called them. This allows the result of a calculation or operation to be
          stored in a variable or used directly in another expression. Returning
          values makes functions powerful building blocks for complex logic.
          Many JavaScript programs rely heavily on functions to control the flow
          of data and behavior throughout the application.
        </p>
        <code>
          function greet(user) {
            return "Hello, " + user;
          }
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li>Functions are defined using the <code>function</code> keyword</li>
          <li>They help organize and reuse code efficiently</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>
          Loops are used in JavaScript to repeatedly execute a block of code as
          long as a specified condition remains true. They are especially useful
          when working with lists of data, such as arrays, or when performing
          repetitive tasks. Without loops, developers would have to write the
          same code multiple times, which would be inefficient and error-prone.
          Loops make programs shorter, cleaner, and easier to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript includes several types of loops, such as <code>for</code>,
          <code>while</code>, and <code>do...while</code>. Each type of loop is
          suited for different situations depending on how and when the loop
          condition should be checked. Choosing the correct loop structure helps
          ensure that code runs efficiently and avoids infinite loops, which can
          crash or freeze an application.
        </p>
        <code>
          for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
          }
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li><code>for</code> loops are useful when the number of iterations is known</li>
          <li><code>while</code> loops run as long as a condition remains true</li>
        </ul>

        <header>Objects</header>
        <p>
          Objects are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript.
          They are used to store related data and functionality together in a
          single structure. Objects consist of properties, which are key-value
          pairs that describe characteristics or behavior. This makes objects
          ideal for representing real-world entities such as users, products,
          or settings within an application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects help organize code by grouping related information together,
          making programs easier to understand and maintain. They also support
          methods, which are functions stored as object properties. By combining
          data and behavior, objects form the foundation of object-oriented
          programming in JavaScript. Most modern JavaScript applications rely
          heavily on objects to manage complex data and interactions.

          const person = {
            name: "Alex",
            age: 25

        </code>
        <code>
          console.log(person.name);
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li>Objects are created using curly braces <code>{}</code></li>
          <li>Properties are accessed using dot notation</li>
          <li>Objects can store both data and methods</li>
